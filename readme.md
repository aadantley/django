## Notes

### Blog

- added a Post model with a slug field.
- Added a customized admin panel for the Post model.
- Added sample post records.
- added a custom model manager for published posts.
- added a list and detail view for the post records.
- created a custom get_absolute_url function for linking data to a specific template.
- added template files.

## Take Aways

- Watching the html files for Django templates is important; make sure there are no line breaks between the words defining a content block.

## To Dos

- figure out why the model manager will not allow creating a post from the admin panel.
